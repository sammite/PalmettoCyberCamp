Hello! This is the template code for which I have a subset of the work on Palmetto Cyber Summer Camp. 
Mostly you will see directories for each course, and course names do change from year to year, so may have to do a little bit of hunting to find what you are looking for.

But for the moment:

understandvulns - this is the source code for the applications that we have the students break in the "Understanding Vulnerabilities" and similar classes.

mal_vuln_scan - source code for a conceptual "trojan" to show students how malware works.

comp - source code for files for the competition at the end of camp, specifically for the highschool tracks. Note that the flags embedded here will be changed before the competition begins. :)
You will note also that there are subdirs for each set of flags here. Please use them!

Happy hacking!
